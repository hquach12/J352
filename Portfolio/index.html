            <p>Daniel grew up in Wilmette, IL, a suburb of Chicago, where a love of sports was instilled within him at an early age. Daniel's love for sports broadcasting started as a kid where he would pretend to be the play-by-play man for his Madden games. Daniel started broadcasting games in his sophomore year at New Trier Township High School for New Trier's radio station, WNTH. He spent three years broadcasting for WNTH, including his senior year where he served as Sports Director for the station.</p>
            <P>Following graduating high school, Daniel traveled east to study journalism at the University of Maryland. So far in his two years in College Park, Daniel has broadcasted nearly every sport at Maryland, from field hockey to football. He broadcasts games for UMD's student radio station WMUC Sports and the Maryland Baseball Network. He also reports for Terrapin Sports Central, an on-campus club that covers UMD athletics and produces a weekly studio show, The Left Bench.
