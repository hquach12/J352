<p>Hello! My name is Henry Quach, I'm a sophomore journalism student at the University of Maryland, and I work for multiple campus publications. I grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland and graduated from Springbrook High School in 2023. I've worked for as a staff writer for WMUC Sports for almost a year and most recently served as the women's soccer beat writer. I also write for La Voz Latina with a main focus on covering sports. Additionally, I'm proficient with Adobe Suite and can speak multiple languages! See some of my writing below.</p>
