<p>After Marvel released its third phase of movies that have gave the right enterainment and enjoyment for many fans. It was also set to bring on a brand new phase to witness the future of Marvel moving forward as the main casts were leaving Marvel Studios in hopes that new actors can step up to earn the important roles for upcoming projects. With actors like Liam Helsmworth, Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr. No longer playing in the golden roles as their first character, when they were introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the early years, They needed new actors to take their characters onto the new light and step up to have that golden opportuntiy of leading the projects. The future looked promising as new stars were set to headline in new movies and series in which would be Marvel's first attempt to join the television series industry after Disney Plus was also created. Marvel introduced the first phase 4 plans ahead and it was a more smaller and condensed timeline of projects that were set to be considered in that phase</p>

<p>However, The photo would not be the final consideraion of Phase 4, As the days gone by, more projects were listed for both the cinematic universe and television series to see how would it perform. Now, there are other Movie franchises that have converted into these roles before like Star Wars, Harry Potter, James Bond. Some have been successful on making the transition and Marvel has been sucessful in handling both sides of projects but there have been some mishaps to quality in some of the films. In which, it has caused them to earn lower profit than other movies and also more negative reviews</p>

<p>As shown from the infogram above, only two out of the rest of the Marvel projects have received an eight or above, which concerns the rest of the projects. These projects were supposed to build a new story of the universe with the iconic characters, no longer gaining that top role, but so far, it hasn't paid off. So many projects had the potential to be up on the rankings but have failed to produce due to three things: Bad CGI and effects, poor character development, and poor storytelling.</p>

    <h3>Bad CGI Moments</h3>
    <img src="Images/blackwidow.jpg"> <img src="Images/DS2.jpg"> <img src="Images/animal.jpg"> <img src="Images/Thor.jpg">
    <p>As we start with the first coverage on how Marvel has not risen in hopes to build what was the future of Marvel, things did not look good as we take a look at CGI. As shown in the photos above, this was one of many issues that Marvel dealt with at the production level and the VFX effects, as you can see in the photo. Now, of course, budget is very important for the effects of the movie, and they did receive high budgets for the film, However, it didn't help, and Marvel lost money for the production level as the box office money was lower than the budget that was given. After this project was considered a flop by reviewers, many thought that Marvel could bounce back and have a better attempt at the visual effects. That turned out not to be the case, and more examples have appeared in all sorts of shows and films.</p>
    <p>In the first photo, this photo was from the film "Black Widow" now this movie had some disadvtanges as it was during the pandemic and it was forced to release onto Disney Plus but you can tell the quality of that scene, it just looked blurry and it wasn't clear focused at all. We next look at a scene from Doctor Strange: The Multiverse of Madness as we see Doctor Strange trying to talk to the protectors of the multiverse, but the stage he was on clearly looked like it didn't cover the stage and looked like a soundstage.</p>
    <p>The third photo, is from the TV series "MoonKnight," as we see the picture of one of monsters that appear in the show, now it may seem okay but the rendering on the monster is what makes it standout not in the right way and it may just look like the monster was added onto the scene as like a photo or the background is the photo and it doesn't have a clear factor to see that it's in the actual building itself. Lastly, we have a scene from "Thor: Love and Thunder" as we see a kid's hologram that is trying to send a message to Thor to not give up and to save them, after they were captured. Now, this scene was fixed later on, but before it just looked like it was slowly fading away, and the quality of the image wasn't at its highest peak.</p>
    <p>So clearly, despite having a good budget for the films, after marketing as well, special effect and CGI is still a recurring issue for Marvel.</p>

                <h3>Poor Character Devlopment</h3>
                <img src="Images/currentheros (1).jpg">
                <p>Next, we head onto character development.  There have been some characters that could've had the potential to take on those next golden roles after the likes of Iron Man and Captain America were no longer part of the projects going forward. They have introduced other characters into the universe that have the potential, but they haven't performed to the level at all. However it's not the actor's fault, it's the writing behind for those characters is what has been bad for the characters to not be able to reach their full potential.</p>
                <p>There have been other characters that were introduced, but so far, it is been their only time to showcase who they are and what they can do to help with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, some either simply haven't gotten the chance or haven't stepped up in their current roles, and it has haunted their chances to take the big step into the cinematic universe.</p>
                <p>it is simply because we haven't gotten a chance to see the other characters perform for the biggest stages, in theaters, the likes of MoonKnight and DareDevil that haven't appeared in the films, and some fans will only know who the character is if they watch the TV series but they already gotten the spotlight, now give them a chance on the big screen. Now there have been other characters that have made it to the big screen but there is no buildup for the character at all and it's just straight to the point, without any knowledge of the development of the character, it leaves dissapointment after excitement to see what is the character all about, just to be right into the action in short matter.</p>

                <h3>Poor Storytelling</h3>
                <img src="Images/lessons-marvel.jpg">
                <p>Lastly, storytelling. it is one of the most key important things to look forward for when it comes to a series and movies as it builds up the excitement and drama on what's to come ahead, however that's not been the case with Marvel at all, in fact, The storytelling of Marvel project has been confusing despite their best efforts to connect every series and movie, but it isn't leading anywhere since there wasn't an Avengers movie in the works until recently.</p>
                <p>Before making its new plans to finally have a new Avengers movie in the works, before that, there wasn't any build-up to help benefit the idea for Marvel, and it didn't have a direction to head forward.</p>
                <p>These characters have acted things that aren't common to the storyline at all when it comes to connecting to the Marvel universe for example, in the "She-Hulk" series, There was a scene where a collab with Megan Thee Stallion happened and it was completely off the hook on the main purpose of the show. All sorts of videos and reviews were not happy with the scene at all and were questioning Marvel's decision to keep that scene. Other examples like "The Marvels" had no built up storytelling development and was all over the place, stories have been repetitive, and what was mentioned eariler character development has been ruined due to poor storytelling as the character we all know from the comics or past movies and or series, has lost their importance and try to change the way that the character is supposed to be played.</p>
                <p>The direction has been and still is in question as of today of what they are trying to plan for ahead because right now, their direction is going in circles and ending up in the same bad situation that they put themselves in.</p>
